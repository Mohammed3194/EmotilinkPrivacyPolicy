   </p> 
</div>
<div style='padding: 25px;text-align: justify'>
   <p>Thank you for considering emotilink, a telemental health platform and digital marketplace (hereafter, the ‚Äúplatform‚Äù) where users like you can search for and connect to independent, licensed mental health professionals (‚Äúproviders‚Äù) using our secure and HIPAA-compliant mobile application.</p>
   <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we use, share and protect the information we collect about you over our platform. By registering as a user and using our platform, you consent to the collection, use and storage of your information as detailed herein.</p>
   <p>Our Privacy Policy exists to protect you, so please take the time to read it <u>carefully</u>.</p>
   <p>Emotilink reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at anytime, for any reason, without notice. The date we last updated the policy can be found at the top and bottom of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to check for updates. Your continued access or use of the platform after any update shall be deemed your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
   <p>
   <h3>What Information We Collect About You</h3>
   Our platform is designed to simplify the delivery of professional, real-time telemental health services while still meeting the highest standards of security and privacy. One of the ways our design accomplishes this is by limiting the information we collect over our platform, reasoning that the simplest and most efficient way to protect sensitive information is to never collect it in the first place.</p>
   <p>You can generally visit our website, download our mobile application (for free) and peruse the available providers without revealing who you are or sharing any personal information about yourself. In order to schedule an actual appointment with a provider, however, you first must create an emotilink account‚Äîa process which requires that you to share certain, minimal information about yourself.</p>
   <div style='text-align: justify;padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px'>
      <i>When you create an emotilink account, you must share the following:</i>
      <ol>
         <li><u>User-Created Login Credentials</u></li>
         <p>Your username (personal email address) and password (for logging in) as well as your ‚ÄòDisplay Name‚Äô (the name you choose to share with your providers),</p>
         <li><u>User Contact Information</u></li>
         <p>Your first and last name, mobile telephone number (used for security verification purposes and to respond to your inquiries, comments or complaints, if any), your state of residence (used to identify eligible providers) and your private, personal email address (used for the delivery of legal notices, security alerts, session reminders, transactional receipts, and to respond to your inquiries or complaints, if any)</p>
         <li><u>User Payment Instructions</u></li>
         <p>Standard information needed to process credit card payments‚Äîspecifically your name, address and credit card detail (‚ÄúPayment Instructions‚Äù). Unlike the above information, you will not be required to input your Payment Instructions until you submit your first appointment-scheduling request with a provider.</p>
         <i>And in the course using our platform, we further collect on a continuing basis:</i></br></br>
         <li><u>Session, Scheduling and Transaction History</u></li>
         <p>Basic details regarding your session and scheduling history (date, time and duration) as well as basic transactional records (such as the amount, time and date of any payments processed over our platform),</p>
         <li><u>Legal Notices, Authorizations and Correspondences</u></li>
         <p>Record of your approval of certain legal agreements and notices, such as record of your agreement to this our Terms of Use, Email Authorization,\n" +
            "\n" +
            "and Session Minimum and Cancellation Policy, as well as your approval and receipt by email (read receipt requested) of each of your providers‚Äô HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices and any consent forms or notices your providers choose to supply,
         </p>
         <li><u>Elective Preferences (optional)</u></li>
         <p>Your preferred list of providers, anonymous provider rating, notification preferences and your profile photo, if any,</p>
         <li><u>Communications (optional)</u></li>
         <p>Record of your email, telephone or mail communications with us, if any,</p>
         <li><u>Server Log Files</u></li>
         <p>Default information customarily saved by web servers‚Äîspecifically the date, time and originating IP address of each time you sign into your account, request an action in the platform‚Äôs mobile application and the completion status of those requests. Server Log Files are generated automatically, in a highly technical format, and stored on our secure servers (in encrypted format) to help us resolve customer support queries and monitor system performance and security.</p>
      </ol>
   </div>
   <p>Significantly, the above-enumerated information is the <u>only</u> information we collect about you over our platform. Your sessions with providers are private and accessible by you and your providers alone</p>
   <h3>How We Store Your Information</h3>
   <p>Some of the information we collect about you, when transmitted electronically over our platform, may constitute Protected Health Information (‚ÄúPHI‚Äù) within the meaning of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-191) and its related regulations, amendments and clarifying acts (collectively, ‚ÄúHIPAA‚Äù).</p>
   <p>In keeping with HIPAA, the information we collect (enumerated earlier) is stored on secure servers and encrypted both while in transit and at rest. Access to the information is closely monitored for security purposes and restricted to essential personnel only‚Äîeach of whom must pass rigorous vetting, are routinely trained on how to securely access, handle and preserve the privacy of that information, and where required by HIPAA, have entered into a business associate agreement with emotilink.</p>
   <h3>What Information We Share with Your Providers</h3>
   <p>Of the minimum information we collect about you (enumerated above), emotilink <u>only</u> shares with your providers your Display Name, state of residence and profile photo (if any). Your providers do not have access to your first or last name, login credentials, email or residential address, Payment Instructions, or user preferences‚Äîwhat information you choose to share with your providers during your sessions (beyond your Display Name, state and optional photo) is entirely up to you and completely voluntary, and <u>where permitted by your provider</u>, you may even participate in your sessions anonymously (although in order to do so you must engage a provider whose profile explicitly states that they accept anonymous users and further choose a Display Name that bears no resemblance to your real name or relation to your identity).</p>
   <h3>How long we retain your data</h3>
   <p>We retain your information for at least as long as your emotilink account remains active.</p>
   <p>Accounts that have been inactive for a continuous period of 12 or more months will be terminated.</p>
   <p>If you would like your account terminated sooner, please send a termination request either by email to <u style='color: blue'>emotilink@gmail.com</u> or by mail to our Chicago mailing address found at the bottom this policy. Please include in the body of your request your Username to assist with verification. We will terminate your account within a reasonable period of time upon receiving your request to allow for processing.</p>
   <p>Terminating your account will <u>not</u>, however, delete your account information.</p>
   <p>We are required by our agreements with providers to retain records of your appointment and transaction history as well as your receipt and approval of all legal notices for a period of at least 7 years.</p>
   <p>Additionally,\n" +
      "\n" +
      "server log files and any information we collect over the platform that have been scrubbed of your personally identifiable information to the degree required to de-identify that information in compliance with HIPAA may be retained indefinitely and used for any purpose. De-identified information is information from which all personal identifiers‚Äîsuch as your name, display name, residential street address, photo, etc.‚Äîhas been removed.
   </p>
   <p>If you are concerned about the information you have shared with us or would like to review, update, or delete this information, please contact us at <u style='color: blue'>infor@emotilink.com</u>. We will make reasonable efforts to comply with your requests in a timely fashion.</p>
   <h3>How We Secure Your Real-Time Communications over the Platform</h3>
   <p>Maintaining the privacy and security of your real-time communications is our highest priority. For this reason our platform implements multiple security measures to ensure that <u>only</u> you and your provider (and no one else‚Äînot even emotilink) can access the decrypted content of your real-time communications over our platform.</p>
   <p>The real-time video teleconferencing technology (‚ÄúWebRTC‚Äù) imbedded within our platform employs as its core security protocols SRTP (Secure Real-Time Protocol) for media traffic encryption and DTLS-SRTP (Datagram Transport Layer Security extension) for key negotiation. This means that the mobile application at each endpoint utilizes an algorithm known as the AES cipher (Advanced Encryption Standard) to generate random 128-bit encryption keys, which are then exchanged between and utilized by the endpoints to both encrypt and decrypt the transmitted audio and video data comprising your real-time communication. New keys are generated within the application itself (with multiple keys generated at random intervals during any given session) and deleted immediately upon expiration. Key-Hash Mesh Authentication Codes (HMACs) are employed to protect key transmissions, and no key is used to encrypt data until the integrity of its transmission has first been verified.</p>
   <p>Additionally, because your communications are encrypted and decrypted at each endpoint within the mobile application itself (rather than in the cloud) and remains encrypted from endpoint-to-endpoint without interruption, you can rest assured that your real-time communications with providers remain protected even when you or your provider connect to the platform over an open public network or hotspot.</p>
   <p>Despite these security measures, the confidentiality of any information and communication transmitted or stored electronically, whether through our platform or any other media, cannot be guaranteed. Please remember that no method of electronic transmission over the Internet or method of storage can be 100% secure. You acknowledge and agree that you share and transmit the information at your own risk, as further detailed in our Terms of Use. If you have reason to believe that there has been of security, including but limited to 'hacking' to your account, you must notify us immediately.</p>
   <h3>When We Can Disclose Your Information</h3>
   <p>Emotilink LLC owns the information we collect over our platform subject to applicable privacy laws governing its use and the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. We do not sell, rent, or loan ANY of your information to third parties and do not share your information with any third parties except (i) as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, (ii) where you direct and authorize us in writing to do so, or (iii) where required by law or to comply with legal process, such as where compelled by court order or subpoena.</p>
   <p>Should Emotilink LLC ever be acquired by or merge with another company, convert or restructure as a new or different entity, or transfer substantially all of its assets or control to another party, Emotilink LLC may in connection with any such transaction transfer its ownership of your information to the acquiring or resulting entity. No such acquisition, merger, conversion, restructure or transfer, however, will relieve or\n" +
      "\n" +
      "diminish the acquiring or resulting entity‚Äôs obligations and responsibilities to continue to protect your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, and the applicable privacy laws like HIPAA.
   </p>
   <p>Under limited circumstances, we may further share your information with third party contractors or vendors whom we retain to perform discrete, limited functions necessary for the operation of our platform. Such third-parties may not access or use your information except where and to the extent necessary to perform their discrete functions and will not be granted access to your information unless they either (i) first enter into a HIPAA-compliant business associate agreement with emotilink or (ii) fall within one of the recognized exceptions to the business associate rule, namely the ‚ÄúFinancial Institution Exception‚Äù (and thus where the third-party is a financial institution and only receives Payment Instructions to perform payment processing and deposit services) and the ‚ÄúMere Conduit Exception‚Äù (where the third party serves as a mere conduit for the transmission of your encrypted communications but cannot access the decrypted content of those communications)</p>
   <h3>Your Providers‚Äô Responsibilities under HIPAA and other laws</h3>
   <p>Many if not most of the providers featured on the platform meet HIPAA‚Äôs definition of a ‚Äúcovered entity‚Äù and are therefore subject to HIPAA‚Äôs requirement that every covered entity adopt and implement privacy practices that adequately secure and protect any PHI (i.e. Protected Health Information) entrusted to their care. Pursuant to this requirement, providers whose services you engage over the platform must furnish you with a written notice (‚ÄúHIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices‚Äù) describing (i) how the HIPAA Privacy Rule allows the provider to use and disclose your PHI (and when your authorization is required before your provider can share your information for any other reason), (ii) the provider‚Äôs duty to protect your PHI, (iii) your privacy rights, including the right to complain to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as to the provider if you believe your privacy rights have been violated, and (iv) how to contact the provider for more information or to make a complaint.</p>
   <p>Each provider is <u>solely</u> responsible for the compliance of his or her professional practice and services with HIPAA and all other federal, state and local laws. To facilitate this compliance, each provider as a condition of registering as a provider on the platform must first furnish emotilink with a pfd copy of the provider‚Äôs HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices, as well as pdfs of any other notices the provider chooses to supply in order to comply with applicable law. To effect delivery of these notices, each and every time you schedule an introductory appointment with a new provider, the email we send you to confirm your appointment (read receipt requested) will contain as pdf attachments the various notices supplied by that provider. You must read these notices carefully and ask your provider any questions you may have about their contents. Providers are responsible for confirming your receipt and understanding of these notices and should review their contents with you during your introductory appointment.</p>
   <p>The email delivery of notices like the HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices is essential to the operation of our platform. If you do not want to receive such notices by email, <u>you must refrain from using our platform</u>.</p>
   <h3>What Information We Share in the Event of an Emergency</h3>
   <p>Most if not all providers are duty, if not legally and ethically bound to notify the proper authorities in the event they reasonably believe a patient poses an imminent risk to his or herself or to others. To assist providers in fulfilling this duty, all users as a condition of registering as an emotilink user agrees to grant our platform access to your device‚Äôs GPS location services whenever you log into your emotilink account. We do not access, collect or use your GPS location except under the exigent circu\n" +
      "\n" +
      "to yourself or to others, and is without any suitable alternative and less invasive means to intervene. Under those circumstances (and only those circumstances), your provider may press an emergency button within the provider‚Äôs mobile application, which in turn will connect your provider to your local emergency service provider (typically 911) and transmit your GPS location to that emergency service provider.
   </p>
   <h3>You Must be at Least 18 to Use the Platform</h3>
   <p>Although we may someday develop a platform for children, emotilink is not that platform (at least not yet)</p>
   <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to become an emotilink user. Our platform is neither designed for nor intended to be used by children under the age of 13. If you're aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 please let us know by contacting us and we will delete that information.</p>
   <p>We also do not allow anyone under the age of 18 to use the Platform without parental consent, authorization and presence.</p>
